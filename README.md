# HydraNet
Hedera Token Service Integration with Zokrates JS

## Inspiration
- zkERC20
- zkTokens
- Zether Framework
- NoteStream
- AZTECH Protocol
- ERC 1724
- Hedera Consensus Service

## What it does
- Creation of Zero Knowledge Proofs for HTS Token Transactions

## How we built it
- ZokratesJS
- Zokrates CLI
- HTS Integration

## Challenges we ran into
- Lack of JS based Verifier for Zokrates Circuits

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Creation of Token Transaction Proofs for HTS

## What we learned
- Zokrates JS
- Hedera Token Service

## What's next for HydraNet
- Zokrates Proofs for Token Bonding Curves 
- Zokrates Proofs for Token Curated Registries
- Zokrates Proofs for Token Vaults
